# Float
Float is an immersive narrative adventure game that follows a 13-year-old girl named Aria as she explores themes of loneliness, belonging, helplessness, and social isolation, trying to unite with the one person who she feels truly understands her.

This repository contains the source code for the game. To play our final executable for the Global Game Jam, go [here](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/float-4) or play on [itch.io](https://tsunam1-surfers.itch.io/float). 
If you want to build the latest source code, we will add instructions on how to do so soon. 
You may also monitor this repository for updates on the game.
